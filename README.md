## Configuration
Once you clone this repository there are two required steps to run the sample app:
1. Create a [free Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com), note the cloud name - you'll need to type it
in when running the app for the  first time. 
2. Create an upload preset named 'ios_sample' in your cloudinary account console:
    *  Login to your [Cloudinary console](https://cloudinary.com/console), go to settings>upload, scroll down
